    "+ Overall, rate of readmissions is trending down with increasing number of discharges\n",
    "+ With lower number of discharges, there is a greater incidence of excess rate of readmissions (area shaded red)\n",
    "+ With higher number of discharges, there is a greater incidence of lower rates of readmissions (area shaded green) \n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Statistics**\n",
    "+ In hospitals/facilities with number of discharges < 100, mean excess readmission rate is 1.023 and 63% have excess readmission rate greater than 1 \n",
    "+ In hospitals/facilities with number of discharges > 1000, mean excess readmission rate is 0.978 and 44% have excess readmission rate greater than 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Conclusions**\n",
    "+ There is a significant correlation between hospital capacity (number of discharges) and readmission rates. \n",
    "+ Smaller hospitals/facilities may be lacking necessary resources to ensure quality care and prevent complications that lead to readmissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**D. Regulatory policy recommendations**\n",
    "+ Hospitals/facilties with small capacity (< 300) should be required to demonstrate upgraded resource allocation for quality care to continue operation.\n",
    "+ Directives and incentives should be provided for consolidation of hospitals and facilities to have a smaller number of them with higher capacity and number of discharges."
